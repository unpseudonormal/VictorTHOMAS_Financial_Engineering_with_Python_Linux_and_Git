TD4/9: Work with secured distant communica-
tion tools
Exercise 1: SSH


3. Connect to the distant server via your terminal
— Do chmod 400 your private key file. The connection won’t work other-
wise
— Use an SSH instruction to connect to your remote instance
— Exit to return to your local machine

 ssh -i /home/admin victorthomas8421@172.31.32.247
chmod 400 /home/admin

4. Create a script named connect.sh to automatically connect to the remote
instance
nano connect.sh
ssh -i /home/admin victorthomas8421@ 172.31.32.247
chmod +x connect.sh

5. Run the script to check it is working properly. Then exit to return to
your local machine.

6. Rename your private key to make it a hidden file. Propagate the changes
to your script. Run the script.


Exercise 2: SCP
1. On your local machine create a file named test_to_remote_instance.txt
2. Connect to your remote instance and create a file named test_from_remote_instance.txt.
Then exit
3. Use the scp command to :
— Send your file test_to_remote_instance.txt to the home folder of your
remote instance
— Get the file test_from_remote_instance.txt to your current local di-
rectory
4. Create two scripts :
— scp_to_remote_instance.sh and scp_from_remote_instance.sh to res-
pectively send and get data with your remote instance
— Since you would like to send or receive any file (not just the test file),
your scripts should use the path of the file to send / receive as an
argument
5. Test your scripts with varying files

TD5/9: Work with APIs (Application Program-
ming Interface)
Exercise 1: Extract data from a website
The Domesday Book is the greatest medieval census. It lists the manors
(private properties) in every place of every county in England in the years 1066
and 1086, before and after the Norman conquest. OpenDomesday presents it
in a modern-human-readable website, as well as an application programming
interface (API).
We will use this API to extract some data from our command-line shell.
The Internet is your friend, do not hesitate to ask his help to find
a better command.
Exercise 1:.1 curl
Check the data on https ://opendomesday.org/api/, for instance
— https ://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/county/
— https ://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/place/2346/
— https ://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/manor/181/


curl https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/county/
curl https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/place/2346/
curl https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/manor/181/



Exercise 1:.2 curl and grep
Let’s try to get the ids for all the places in Derbyshire !

curl https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/county/Derbyshire/ | grep -oP '(?<="id":)\d+'

Exercise 1:.3 curl, grep and for
Now that we have ids for all the places in Derbyshire, we can load all their
details...
And from their details, we can list all the details of their manors.
Go grep the data !
You may write the raw data into a file to avoid downloading it
everytime

nano C1.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Retrieve the ids of all the places in Derbyshire
ids=$(curl https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/county/Derbyshire/ | grep -oP '(?<="id":)\d+')

# Loop through the ids and retrieve the details of each place and its manors
for id in $ids
do
    # Retrieve the details of the place
    place=$(curl https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/place/$id/)
    echo "$place" >> derbyshire_places.json
    
    # Extract the ids of the place's manors
    manor_ids=$(echo "$place" | grep -oP '(?<="manor":)\[\d+(,\d+)*\]' | grep -oP '\d+')

    # Loop through the manor ids and retrieve the details of each manor
    for manor_id in $manor_ids
    do
        manor=$(curl https://opendomesday.org/api/1.0/manor/$manor_id/)
        echo "$manor" >> derbyshire_manors.json
    done
done


bash c1.sh


Exercise 1:.4 curl, grep, for and sed
Now that we have a heap of raw data, we will extract the interesting parts.
In our case we want to count the geld paid by each manor and compare it to
the number of ploughs it owns.
— Can you find the corresponding json fields ?
— Then you can list these numbers for each manor in Derbyshire.
— And format this in a proper comma-separated values (CSV) file
